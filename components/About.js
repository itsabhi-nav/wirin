              WIRIN – Wipro IISc Research and Innovative Network in association
              with RV College of Engineering, Bangalore has taken initiative to
              Create and provide National Dataset.
              <br />
              <br />
              Dataset refers to the meticulous process of creating, curating,
              and assembling a comprehensive collection of images to serve as a
              foundational resource for various applications, such as training
              machine learning models or conducting research. This intricate
              process involves carefully capturing, selecting, and collecting
              images while also generating novel ones to ensure the dataset
              encompasses a wide range of diverse and representative visual
              content that aligns with the specific objectives and requirements
              of the dataset. The purpose is to establish a rich and extensive
              repository of images that can be utilized for advancing computer
              vision, pattern recognition, and related fields by providing
              valuable data for algorithmic analysis, model training, and
              algorithmic performance evaluation.
